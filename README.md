## Modules

The course will consist of three modules: Teachable Machine, Generative AI and self-directed projects

### [Module 1: Teachable Machine](/modules/module1-teachable-machine/)

This first module will give an introduction to using machine learning to classify images, sounds and body poses. These classifications will be an input mechanism for building apps.

#### Exercises

[Exercise 1: Simple Classification Models w/Teachable Machine](/modules/module1-teachable-machine/exercise1-teachable-machine-image-project.md)

[Exercise 2: Export TM Models For Your Own Projects](/modules/module1-teachable-machine/exercise2-export-and-use-model.md)

[Exercise 3: Make a drawing tool using Teachable Machine](/modules/module1-teachable-machine/exercise3-your-first-teachable-machine-app.md)

#### Talks

_Coming soon_

### Module 2: Generative AI

This second module will give an introduction to use the latest wave of AI technologies that allow us to generate text, images and sounds. We will use generative AI as an input mechanism, an output mechanism, and as a thinking tool.

### Module 3: Self-directed project

In this last module, students will define and build their own projects using the tools and techniques they learned during the first two modules.
