## Modules

The course will consist of three modules: Teachable Machine, Generative AI and self-directed projects

### [Module 1: Teachable Machine](/modules/module1-teachable-machine/)

This first module gives an introduction to the field of intelligence in computing. Students use machine learning to classify images, sounds and body poses. These classifications become an input mechanism for building apps.

#### Talks

[Exercise 2: Export TM Models For Your Own Projects](/modules/module1-teachable-machine/exercise2-export-and-use-model.md)

[Exercise 3: Make a drawing tool using Teachable Machine](/modules/module1-teachable-machine/exercise3-your-first-teachable-machine-app.md)

### [Module 2: Generative AI](/modules/module2-generative-ai/)

This second module is an introduction to the latest wave of AI technologies that allow us to generate text, images and sounds. Students use generative AI as an input mechanism, an output mechanism, and as a thinking tool.

#### Talks

[Exercise 5: GPT API](/modules/module2-generative-ai/exercise5-gpt-api.md)

[Exercise 6: Image Generation](/modules/module2-generative-ai/exercise6-image-generation.md)

### Module 3: Self-directed project

In this last module, students will define and build their own projects using the tools and techniques they learned during the first two modules. The focus is on building tools that extend our ability to think and create.
