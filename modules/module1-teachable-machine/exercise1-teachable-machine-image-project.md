# Exercise 1: Simple Classification Models w/Teachable Machine

The goal of this exercise is to learn how to train your own machine learning models that can classify images, sounds and poses. For the exercises in this module, we will use Teachable Machine. Teachable Machine is a web-based tool that makes creating machine learning models fast, easy, and accessible to everyone and was developed by Google.

### Steps

1. Go to http://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/
2. Make a new `Image Project`
3. Train an Image Classification model by following the on-screen instructions and watch the accompanying videos
4. Play around with the Preview-feature of the model.

Can you hack your model and make it detect a false positive? If you are sitting with other groups, test out each others models and give feedback.

How could you make the model more robust? What would adding more classes/samples do to the model?

If you're curious making the model more robust, read the [Extra](#extra)-section.

5. Repeat the exercise, but with a `Sound Project`
6. Repeat the exercise, but with a `Pose Project`
