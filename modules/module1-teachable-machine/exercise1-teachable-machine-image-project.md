![Screenshot from Teachable Machine website of different Project Types: Image, Sound, Pose](/assets/ex1-project-types.png)

1. Go to http://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/
2. Make a new `Image Project`
3. Train an Image Classification model by following the on-screen instructions and watch the accompanying videos
4. Play around with the Preview-feature of the model.

Can you hack your model and make it detect a false positive? If you are sitting with other groups, test out each others models and give feedback.

How could you make the model more robust? What would adding more classes/samples do to the model?

If you're curious making the model more robust, read the [Extra](#extra)-section.

5. Repeat the exercise, but with a `Sound Project`
6. Repeat the exercise, but with a `Pose Project`
