# Exercise 3: Drawing tool

### Brief

Using either a new `image/sound/pose` model, and `P5js` or `HTML/JavaScript`, build a small drawing tool that utilizes the class detection features of either model to draw/manipulate shapes or colors.

To do this, you will combine the things you learned in the previous two exercises by building a new model and embedding it in your programming environment of choice.

Take the term "drawing tool" very liberally in terms of what/how you draw, but try to think about how your tool could enable you to think/make differently.

_Note: If you have an idea you like, but don't know how to build, bring it to class, so we can talk about it_

### Steps

1. Build a model by following the same process as [Exercise 1](#ex1-simple-image-model-with-teachable-machine)

2. Export the model and embed it into your programming environment of choice

3. Build your drawing tool!
