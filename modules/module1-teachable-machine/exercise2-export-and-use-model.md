# Exercise 2: Export model and use in your favorite environment

![](/assets/ex2-export-dialog.png)

In Exercise 1 you learned how to build simple classification model. In this exercise we will focus on how we get the models into our favorite programming environment (P5js or a HTML/Javascript framework).

1. Repeat Exercise 1 or use one of your existing models
2. In the `Preview`-pane, click `Export Model`
3. In the `Tensorflow.js`-tab, make sure `Upload (shareable link)` is selected and click `Upload my model`

_This will generate a public URL that anyone on the internet can potentially access_

4. Pick which environment you want to build in: `P5js` or `HTML/Javascript` and follow the instructions for either:

#### P5js

1. Use this template to get started: https://editor.p5js.org/kevsterino/sketches/w-QhnI3vI
2. Replace the `modelURL` with your own

#### HTML/Javascript

1. In the `Export Model`-dialog, in the bottom `Code Snippets`-section, make sure the `JavaScript`-tab is selected
2. Copy/paste the generated code into your favorite code editor and framework

_Note: even though there is a p5.js-snippet, it doesn't work due to breaking changes in p5js_

## Next steps

Build something fun, either by taking a project you've previously built and augmenting it with controls based on image/sound/pose-detection, or by making something entirely new!
