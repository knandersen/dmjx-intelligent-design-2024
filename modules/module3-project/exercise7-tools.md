# Exercise 7: Tools

_NOTE: If you have chosen to work on your own idea, feel free to skip this exercise, but it required that you book a session with Kevin to talk through your idea!_

_NOTE: For this exercise, it might be helpful to refer back to [Talk 4: Project Brief, Tools](/modules/module3-project/talk4-project-brief-tools.pdf)_

A tool is an object that can extend an individual's ability to modify features of the surrounding environment or help them accomplish a particular task.

Although many animals use simple tools, only human beings, whose use of stone tools dates back hundreds of millennia, have been observed using tools to make other tools.

In this exercise, you will use what you learned in the first two modules to build a tool for yourself or someone else, that might extend your ability to think and create.

## Exercise 7.1: Study your own tools

_When working with this exercise, please prepare it in a format that can be presented_

1. Make a list of tools you use. Think about tools very 'broadly', and feel free to use [this example list of tools](/assets/tools.md) as a source of inspiration. It might also help to think back to a previous project you did, either one where you felt good or really struggled. What were the conditions? what changed the conditions? could those 'condition changers' be considered tools?
2. Using Heidegger's distinction of [`ready-to-hand vs present-at-hand`](https://that-which.com/heidegger-ready-to-hand-and-present-at-hand/), pick 3 of each and put into two lists.
3. Think about each list. What makes the `present-at-hand` tools present at hand? what is it about them? What might make them become `ready-to-hand` eventually? what qualities are important for something to become `ready-to-hand`? Write down these reflections and qualities
4. What makes the `ready-to-hand` tools ready to hand? what is it about them? They were once `present-at-hand`, right? how did they become ready to hand? which qualities do they exhibit? Write these reflections and qualities down.

## Exercise 7.2: Develop a new tool

1. Either separately, or together with a fellow student, generate ideas for what kind of tool might be interesting for you to make. Try not to think too hard about what is realistic or technically possible.
2. [Book a session](/README.md) with Kevin to talk through your idea and how you might build something this week that achieves it.
3. Work on the tool. If you feel like you're stuck or done early, book a session with Kevin for critique and sparring!
